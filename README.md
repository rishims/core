# CORE
This repository contains codes and results related to projects conducted at the Center for Outcomes Research &amp; Evaluation at the Yale New Haven Hospital. Please note that not all results will be accompanied by their corresponding code as this cannot be made available at this time due to various CORE data-protection regulations and team agreements. 

## National Health Interview Survey (NHIS):

The NHIS is a household survey that uses a multistage probability sampling design to select a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, non-institutionalized population. It aims to monitor the health status, health behaviors, healthcare access and utilization, and health disparities among the U.S. population. Each year, approximately 35,000 to 40,000 households are selected to participate in the survey.

The code and result files in this folder pre-process (clean, mine, and manage) raw data extracts from the [NHIS]([url](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/data-questionnaires-documentation.htm)https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/data-questionnaires-documentation.htm), perform logsitic regression on the data to determine trends in healthcare access and utilization from 1999-2021, and then plot the results stratified by race.

These results are part of a larger ongoing project to look at broader trends in mortality and healthcare access and utilization by racial groups, in conjucntion with other datasets from sources such as the [NDI](url) and [CDC WONDER]([url](https://wonder.cdc.gov/)https://wonder.cdc.gov/) (code for these analyses is still ongoing and theefore has not been made available here, though the preliminary results/figures are available in this folder).

## Listen to Immune Symptoms and Treatment Experience Now (LISTEN)

[LISTEN]([url](https://medicine.yale.edu/ycci/listen-study/)https://medicine.yale.edu/ycci/listen-study/) is a study that seeks to research long COVID and vaccine-related conditions by fostering sustained dialogue between an international online community of individuals suffering from these illnesses.

The code and result files in this folder pre-process (clean, mine, and manage) data extracts from LISTEN participant surveys and perform various descriptive and statistical analyses on the data to produce infromative visualizations. Please note that since some of the code is still being refined by our team, specifically code related to the machine learning model and clustering algorithm, this code is not available here but the preliminary results/figures from this analysis can be found in this folder.
